        <b> <u> Pounds </u> </b> <br>
        <br>
        One more time <br>
        Makes a happy 
        <i> little </i>
        me. <br>
        Just three pounds to go, <br>
        Over there, <br>
        Hold it there, <br>
        <br>
        Hold it there. <br>
        <br>
        Photoshopped crop tops, <br>
        <i> They're staring at me. </i> <br>
        Three turns to <br>
        Eight and I <br>
        Wait to consume, <br>
        <br>
        Hours. <br>
        <br>
        Eight turns to <br>
        Five and I <br>
        Still don't want to be alive, <br>
        Tell me. <br>
        Why am I <br>
        Trapped in this <br>
        Shell? <br>
        My own suburban hell where <br>
        Energy is the enemy. <br>
        <br>
        My teeth rot, <br>
        And my heart stops.

        <b> <u> To the Sons and Daughters </u> </b> <br>
        <br>
        Did her laugh make you shudder? <br>
        Did her smile make you meek? <br>
        <br>
        Did her palm across your shoulder <br>
        Make the world seem less bleak? <br>
        <br>
        Did her hair fall down like marigolds, <br>
        And fall out in the end? <br>
        Did life ever prepare you for that monumental bend? <br>
        <br>
        Into <br>
        Night, <br>
        Into Darkness. <br>
        Where we all are meant to go. <br>
        Did those final moments raze you <br>
        When you knew it would be so? <br>
        <br>
        How long before you heal? <br>
        If healing ever comes. <br>
        <br>
        How long before her name might <br>
        Tenderly escape your lungs?
    </p>
